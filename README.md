# ProjectPFD

## Problem Statement and Focus Area

> How to make the OCBC app more accessible to users with neurodegenerative disorders
>
> Specifically people with parkinson's

## Challenges

> Tremors make it hard for users to facilitate specific movements to carry out functions
>
> Vision impairments make it hard for the users to understand the website's content
>
> Memory Loss makes it difficult for users to remember the past actions commited

## Ideas/Solution

1. Utilize Gesture Recognitions -> Minimize the need for specific mouse movements

- Display hand gestures for navigating to different pages
- Display hand gestures to carry out functions like confirmation of paynow payment
- Utilize hand gestures for scrolling
- Utilize hand gestures for voice commands

2. Utilize Voice to Text -> Minimize the need for specific handmovements for typing

- Voice to text for navigation of pages
- Voice to text for inputting forms
- Voice to text for triggering commands

3. Utilize ChatBot -> Answer Enquiries related to the app

- Chatbot to answer questions related to the newly added functions
- Provide OCBC hotline contact details

4. Slideshow -> Inform newly logged in users of the new functions added

- Animation to inform recently logged in users of the newly added functions

5. Face Recognition -> Utilize facial recognition for logging in

- Utilize face recognition for logging into their respective accounts

6. Reminders -> Section within main page that reminds people of their latest actions

- Section within the homepage for logged in users that contains reminders for their latest actions
